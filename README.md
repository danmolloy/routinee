# TaskTrek

## Overview
Track your habits, daily tasks and regular todos. TaskTrek keeps a log on your progress and helps you achieve your goals.

## Features 
There are some tasks you want to do at regular intervals - this could be exercising, meditating or feeding your pet.

TaskTrek keeps a log of these habits. Tick off an activity and log its data - how long you did it for, how you felt about it. You can also add hashtags, which can be used to filter you instances of the activity and see an overall pattern of your activity.

TaskTrek features an intuitive, animated UX and a GitHub-style heat chart.
