## Testing
Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library achieve a high code coverage threshold, focusing on database interaction, maintaining a consistent UI and critical logic. An array of Jest matchers (e.g., .toBe, .toEqual, .toBeInTheDocument) are leveraged for effective assertions. Predictable UI output is maintained with snapshot tests for all components. Test suites are regularly reviewed to ensure failures are swiftly captured, and the site continues to be manually tested across a variety of screen sizes.
